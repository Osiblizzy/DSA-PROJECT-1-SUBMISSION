##ANALYTIC PROCESSES INVOLVED;

. I started by getting the data

. Ingested or understood the data to what exactly I was expected to do

. I then cleaned the data(data transformation) which really wasn't an easy task 

. After which, I went ahead to model my data i.e Table interaction

. Then, visualized using pivot tables and dashboard creation

. I then analyzed based on what has been visualised and finally,

.Presenting it

OBSERVATIONS:

-There was a significant increase in reviews and ratings when price was discounted

-The higher the discounted price,the higher the reviews and ratings

-*Electronics* is one of the products with the highest reviews and rating
